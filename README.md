# Private Voting for Class Polls

## Description

A decentralized smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that enables anonymous voting for class polls and educational settings. This contract provides a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof voting system where participants can cast votes on binary choice questions while maintaining privacy and preventing double voting.

### Key Features
- **Anonymous Voting**: Vote contents are not linked to voter identities
- **Double-Vote Prevention**: Built-in mechanism to ensure one vote per participant
- **Binary Choice Polling**: Simple A/B option voting system
- **Transparent Results**: Real-time vote counting visible to all participants
- **Immutable Records**: All votes are permanently recorded on the blockchain

## Vision

To democratize decision-making in educational environments by providing students and educators with a trustworthy, accessible, and completely transparent voting platform. We envision a future where every classroom decision—from choosing project topics to selecting class representatives—can be made through fair, anonymous, and verifiable digital voting.

Our vision extends beyond simple polling to create a foundation for digital civic engagement, teaching students the principles of democratic participation while leveraging cutting-edge blockchain technology.

## Future Scope

- **Integration APIs**: Connect with popular educational platforms (Google Classroom, Canvas)

### Long-term Vision (1+ years)
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Deploy on multiple blockchain networks
- **Mobile Application**: Dedicated iOS/Android apps for easier access
- **AI-Powered Analytics**: Voting pattern analysis and insights
- **Governance Token**: Community-driven platform development and decision-making
